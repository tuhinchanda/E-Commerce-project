# E-Commerce-project

ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Data Analysis Project (SQL + Python)
This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset using SQL and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to extract meaningful business insights. The objective is to demonstrate data querying, transformation, and visualization skills by solving real-world questions across three levels of complexity: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
MySQL for database querying

Python (Jupyter Notebook)

pandas for data manipulation

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

MySQL Connector for database integration in Python

ðŸ“Œ Project Structure:
ðŸ“˜ Basic Queries:
List all unique cities where customers are located.

Count the number of orders placed in 2017.

Find the total sales per category.

Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.

Count the number of customers from each state.

ðŸ“™ Intermediate Queries:
Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.

Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.

Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.

Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.

Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.

ðŸ“• Advanced Queries:
Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.

Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.

Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.

Calculate the retention rate of customers (defined as customers who repurchase within 6 months).

Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.

ðŸ“Š Outcome:
This project simulates business intelligence tasks that an analyst or data scientist might face in a real e-commerce environment. It showcases:

Strong SQL querying ability across multiple tables

Integration of SQL and Python for end-to-end data analysis

Use of aggregation, joins, window functions, and subqueries

Visual storytelling through charts and metrics
